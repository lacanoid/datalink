Write Access
------------                

When `write_access` is `FS` then 'immutable' state for a file is left unmodified. 
This option does not require datalinker.

When `write_access` is `BLOCKED` then file is changed to 'immutable' state. 
It can't be renamed, modified or deleted neither by a normal user nor superuser.
Datalink column cannot be updated (but can be set to null).

When `write_access` is `ADMIN` then file is changed to 'immutable' state.
Datalink column can always be updated.

When `write_access` is `TOKEN` then file is changed to 'immutable' state.
Datalink column can be updated when appropriate write token is present. 
For example, Token is included in a datalink generated by `DLNEWCOPY()` function.

    mydb=# UPDATE my_table SET link=DLNEWCOPY(link);

Read access
-----------  

When `read_access` is `FS` then file owner and mode are left unmodified. 
This option does not require datalinker.

When `read_access` is `DB` then file owner and mode are changed to a value, 
configured in the datalinker, normally `postgres.postgres` and `0440`.
This makes file effectively owned and readable by the database server.

In addition, if owner (of the table containing the datalink column) is equal to an
existing OS user, it is set as the owner of the file thus making it readable to 
that user. This is meant to work with Postgres *ident* authetication on Debian 
linux and elsewhere.

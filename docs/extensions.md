Extending datalink
==================

Datalink provides some basic infrastructure for handling files within SQL environment.

There are some interesting points in the code where various custom features could be hooked in.

Datalink uses full URLs for representing file addresses, which can be useful in extensions.

Datalink type itself is a variant of jsonb and as such lets you store custom data.

Some functions have arguments with defaults. One can change these to get different default behaviours.
